Welcome to BuildAWeb

Creating a (simple) backend works with some terminal input, as it functions like a program. Unfortunately didn't get the Tkinter program I built to work without bugs, so I keep that locally untill it works bugless.
Due to a lack of time and change of jobs, I unfortunately do not have the time to keep working on this repository. Although I still think I will come back to this, this is as best as it gets for now.

This program treates all the (mainly javascript-) files as text files. Hence, the functionality is really simple to understand. It checks which flags a user specified, checks in a list to what line the flag corresponds and then places them as an attribute in the migration and model files. The routers still need fixing, but they are equally easy to implement. For now, only the router needed to login works.
